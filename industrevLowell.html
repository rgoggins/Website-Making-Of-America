                    <p>Lowell is widely regarded as one of America’s first industrial cities. Lowell’s rise from a small farming town to a booming industrial capital can be attributed to textile industry. During the golden days of Lowell, the city hosted 40 mill buildings that powered 320,000 spindles and employed more than 10,000 workers. Outsiders were often amazed by the sheer industrial scale of the city. John Greenleaf Whittier, an American poet, said Lowell was “like the enchanted palaces of the Arabian Tales” and that “[The observer] feels himself… thrust forward into a new century.” This quote highlights both the tremendous size and presence of industry in Lowell and how the city seemed to be from the future. In this chapter we will examine the rich history of Lowell--starting from its humble start as a farming town and ending with present day Lowell. We explore how multi-faceted and unique this city was--the various local social justice movements and the influential presence of immigrants. Lowell, as you will soon see.</p>

                    <p>Before it was a staggering industrial power, Lowell was a small farming town called Chelmsford, founded in 1650’s. Much of what would soon be considered Lowell was territory that was disputed with the Native Americans. However, by 1675, colonists and Native Americans had established local trading posts. During King Philip’s war, because Chelmsford was one of the western-most colonial towns, Native Americans attacked Chelmsford. As a result of this war, all colonial trade with local Native Americans halted. In 1686, after years of trade stagnation and colonial encroachment Wannalancit, a Penacook leader, formally sold his tribe’s land along the Merrimack and the Concord river. After the sale, Chelmsford absorbed all previously Native American owned land.</p>

                    <p>	The town’s departure from its traditional farming system set it up for . At the end of the 18th century, the town was used for shipbuilding and timber production. With the growing American influence in Atlantic trade, the demand for ships rose.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
